## About

**fw** is a tiny library which helps with **asynchronous
control-flow management** in JavaScript environments

It exploits **functional-style programming** using higher-order functions and other common patterns.
You could use it in conjunction with [hu][hu], for a better approach

## Features

- Support series or parallel control-flow modes
- Collections iterators (each, map...)
- Runs in node and browsers
- Simple and easy-to-use API
- Tiny (~200 SLOC)
- Dependency-free
- Designed to be embedded in other libraries or applications

## Installation

#### Node.js

```bash
$ npm install fw --save
```

#### Browser

Via Bower package manager
```bash
$ bower install fw
```

Or loading the script remotely (just for testing or development)
```html
<script src="//rawgithub.com/h2non/fw/master/fw.js"></script>
```

## Environments

It works properly in any ES5 compliant engine

- Node.js
- Chrome >= 5
- Firefox >= 3
- Safari >= 5
- Opera >= 12
- IE >= 9

## API

```js
var fw = require('fw')
```

### series(tasks, callback)

Run the functions in the array in series (sequentially).
Each function will be executed only if its previous function has completed

If any functions in the series pass an error to its callback,
no more functions are run and callback is immediately
called with the value of the error

##### Arguments

- **tasks** - An array containing functions to run. Each function is passed a `callback(err, result)`
- **callback** - Optional callback to run once all the functions have completed.
This function gets an array of results containing all the result arguments passed
to the task callbacks. `undefined` or `null` values will be omitted from results

```js
fw.series([
  function (next) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      next(null, 1)
    }, 100)
  },
  function (next, result) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      next(null, 2)
    }, 100)
  }
], function (err, results) {
  console.log(err) // → undefined
  console.log(results) // → [1, 2]
})
```

### parallel(tasks, callback)

Run the tasks array of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous function has completed

Once the `tasks` have completed, the results are passed to the final `callback` as an array

##### arguments

- **tasks** - An array containing functions to run. Each function is passed a `callback(err, result)`
- **callback** - Optional callback to run once all the functions have completed.
This function gets an array of results containing all the result arguments passed
to the task callbacks. `undefined` or `null` values will be omitted from results

```js
fw.parallel([
  function (done) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      done(null, 1)
    }, 100)
  },
  function (done, result) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      done(null, 2)
    }, 150)
  }
], function (err, results) {
  console.log(err) // → undefined
  console.log(results) // → [1, 2]
})
```

### whilst(test, fn, callback)

Repeatedly call a function, while test returns true.
Calls callback when stopped or an error occurs

##### arguments

- **test()** - synchronous truth test to perform before each execution of fn.
- **fn(callback)** - A function which is called each time test passes. The function is passed a `callback(err)`, which must be called once it has completed with an optional err argument
- **callback(err)** - A callback which is called after the test fails and repeated execution of `fn` has stopped

```js
var count = 0

fw.whilst(
  function () {
    return count < 3
  },
  function (callback) {
    count++
    setTimeout(callback, 1000)
  },
  function (err) {
    // 3 seconds have passed
  }
)
```

### each(arr, iterator, callback)
**Alias**: `map`

Applies the function iterator to each item in arr, in parallel.
The iterator is called with an item from the list, and a callback for when it has finished

Note that since this function applies iterator to each item in parallel,
there is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order

##### arguments

- **arr** - An array to iterate over
- **iterator(item, callback)** - A function to apply to each item in arr.
The iterator is passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has completed.
If no error has occured, the callback should be run without arguments or with an explicit null argument
- **callback(err)** - A callback which is called when all iterator functions have finished, or an error occurs

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var files = ['package.json', 'bower.json']

fw.each(files, fs.readFile, function (err, results) {
  console.log(err) // → undefined
  console.log(results) // → [Buffer, Buffer]
})
```

### eachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)
**Alias**: `mapSeries`

The same as `each()`, but only iterator is applied to
each item in the array in series

The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed (sequentially)

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var files = ['package.json', 'bower.json']

fw.eachSeries(files, fs.readFile, function (err, results) {
  console.log(err) // → undefined
  console.log(results) // → [Buffer, Buffer]
})
```

## Contributing

Wanna help? Cool! It will be really apreciated :)

You must add new test cases for any new feature or refactor you do,
always following the same design/code patterns that already exist
