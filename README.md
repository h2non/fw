## About

**fw** is a tiny library inspired in `async.js` which
simplifies asynchronous control-flow management in JavaScript environments

It was designed to be minimalist, easy-to-use and easy-to-embed as a
part of other libraries or frameworks.

It runs in node and browsers and it's dependency-free

## Installation

#### Node.js

```bash
$ npm install fw --save
```

#### Browser

Via Bower package manager
```bash
$ bower install fw
```

Or loading the script remotely (just for testing or development)
```html
<script src="//rawgithub.com/h2non/fw/master/fw.js"></script>
```
